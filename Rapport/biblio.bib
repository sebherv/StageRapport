	abstract = {Accurate state estimation for a mobile robot often requires the fusion of data from multiple sensors. Software that performs sensor fusion should therefore support the inclusion of a wide array of heterogeneous sensors. This paper presents a software package, robot\_localization, for the Robot Operating System (ROS). The package currently contains an implementation of an extended Kalman filter (EKF). It can support an unlimited number of inputs from multiple sensor types, and allows users to customize which sensor data fields are fused with the current state estimate. In this work, we motivate our design decisions, discuss implementation details, and provide results from real-world tests.},

	title = {A {Comparative} {Study} of {Filtering} {Methods} for {Point} {Clouds} in {Real}-{Time} {Video} {Streaming}},
	abstract = {Sensors for collecting 3D spatial data from the real world are becoming more important. They are a prime research area topic and have applications in consumer markets, such as medical, entertainment, and robotics. However, a primary concern with collecting this data is the vast amount of information being generated, and thus, needing to be processed before transmitted. To address the issue, several filtering methods have been proposed to remove unimportant data. In this paper, a comparative study is conducted to find which methods work best and under what situation. To collect the 3D spatial data, called point clouds, we used the Microsoft Kinect sensor. In addition, we utilized the Point Cloud Library (PCL) to process and filter the data being generated by the Kinect. Two different computers were setup: a client which collects, filters, and transmits the point clouds; and a server that receives and visualizes the point clouds. In order to compare the filtering methods, quality of service (QoS) metrics such as frame rate, filtering time, and percentage of filter were introduced. These metrics indicate how well a certain filtering method accomplishes the goal of transmitting point clouds from one location to another in real-time. Results show that, regardless of the filtering approach chosen, there is still too much data for a satisfactory QoS. For a real-time system to provide reasonable end-to-end quality, further compression and other techniques need to be developed.},

We explore comprehensively the methods used in the literature to solve the detection of road boundaries and the obstacles as well as the recent trends in the relevant area.
